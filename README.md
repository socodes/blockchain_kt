A blockchain is a chain(list) of related blocks. 

### The structure of block:

A block consist of a list of transaction(in this program a string is used to simplify),
a hash of the previous block in the chain, and a certain nonce value 
which the miner should receive in such a way as to prove that the work spent
block mining has been completed.

Like Bitcoin, cryptographic algorithm SHA-256 is used for hash calculating.
